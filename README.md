# UI Prototype

Reminder that this link will take you to our *low fidelity* ui prototype. 
This means that is that major design decisions are not being made in this prototype, rather we seek to portray general layouts and functionality.

Some examples:
These are examples of 3 different fidelity ranges for a prototype

)

It is important to observe how these low fidelity prototypes are not concrete in their representation of their final product but seek to give a general idea and shared vision of what to expect.

Something like this would be a high fidelity prototype of facebook

And here is a mid range of an Amazon page, while it may seem very similar to what you're used to notice the bounding boxes, buttons, text layout, etc are not a perfect representation of how the final page looks.
